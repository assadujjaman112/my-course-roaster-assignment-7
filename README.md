Project Features :-

<!-- 1.Components : A component is a bit of code which can be reusable. Component divides the UI into small pieces. The primary job of a react component is to render its user interface and update it whenever its internal stage is changed. We can say that components are more like javascript functions that starts with capital letter.

2.useEffect : Using Effect hook we can perform side effects in functional components. There are different examples of side effect such as data fetching, manually changing the DOM in react component etc. useEffect hook accepts two arguments first one is a function and second one is dependency. But the dependency argument is optional.

3.props : props are more like a function arguments in javascript and attributes in HTML. By props we can pass data from one component to another component as parameters. props are like communicators whom are used by components to communicate each other. Every parent component can pass data to its child using props. props are immutable that means we cannot modify props. -->
